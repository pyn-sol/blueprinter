# BluePrinter

Generates easy-to-use blueprints for your end users.  

## Example Usage
To see an example of how to use Blueprinter, run the following in a python script:  

```
from blueprinter.templates import inline
inline()
```

## Capabilities
Currently, Blueprinter provides 'inline' snippets.  
When called, your example code or template will replace the contents of the calling file.  

Future additions to this library will allow entire folders to be written to the calling file's directory of choice.
